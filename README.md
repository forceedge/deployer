# deployer
A script that will handle project deployment on a remote ssh server

To get started run 

```
git clone https://github.com/forceedge/deployer.git; chmod 0777 deployer/init.sh; deployer/init.sh
```

You will need to rename the main.sh.dist file to main.sh for deployer to work.

## Dependencies
The local machine and remote server must have git installed.
